## Project Title
Data Warehousing and SQL Optimization

## Description
This repository hosts a collection of SQL scripts alongside detailed educational materials focused on advanced data warehousing techniques and SQL query optimization. The project includes strategies for enhancing database performance through the use of materialized views, dimensional objects, and efficient query techniques.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Oracle SQL Developer or any SQL execution environment that supports Oracle's PL/SQL.

### Installation
- Download and install Oracle SQL Developer if not already installed.
- Clone this repository or download the required files to your local machine.

### Executing the Program
- Open the SQL scripts in your SQL environment.
- Execute the scripts as per the instructions within each file to see how they enhance query performance and implement data warehousing principles.

## Repository Contents
- **SQL Scripts**: Contain definitions and queries for materialized views, demonstrating optimization techniques.
- **Educational Materials**:
  - `final.docx` and `final_pdf.pdf`: Provide assignment instructions or theoretical discussions.
  - `4.3 Facts.pdf`: Discusses fact tables in detail.
  - `SQL Materialised View and Dimensional Objects.pdf`: A guide on creating and using materialized views.
  - `Sales History Dimensional Model(1) (1).docx`: Describes a dimensional model that complements the SQL scripts.

## FAQs

### How do I set up the database configurations?
Follow the instructions in `code.sql` to configure your database environment properly. This file includes comments that guide you through setting up the necessary database objects and configurations.

### What are materialized views?
Materialized views are database objects that store the results of a query physically; thus, they can speed up query processing, especially for complex queries involving large amounts of data.

### How can I contribute to this project?
Contributors can fork the repository, make their improvements, and submit a pull request. All contributions are welcome!
